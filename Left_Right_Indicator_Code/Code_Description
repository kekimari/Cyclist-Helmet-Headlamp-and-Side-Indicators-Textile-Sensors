The Left and Right LEDS are controlled via external interrupts.
The interrupts are triggered only when a signal is detected from the respective pin.
Note, both LEDs cannot be blinking at the same time, thus if one is blinking and an interrupt occurs the other one is stopped.
In order to avoid the occurence that a interrupt occurs when one LED is on and retunr to this state when the LED that interrupted is off, a non-interrupt has been wrapped around 
the crtical section, section where an interrupt cannot occur.
