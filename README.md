# Cyclist-Helmet-Headlamp-and-Side-Indicators-Textile-Sensors

This aim of this project is to build capacitive touch sensors, which will be used to control the Headlamp and Side Indicators.
The Headlamp is operated in two modes automatic and manual mode.
In manual mode the Headlamp is turned on by depressing its respective touch sensor located at the base of the helmet
In automatic mode the Headlamp is turned on by a Light Sensor, in poor visibilty. 
The right and left Indicators are activated by depresseing either of its capacitive sensor
Only one indicator can be active at a time,  blinking for a periodic of time
The indicators are added safety features to mimic the operation of automobile indicators.
