The prototype has HeadLamp (Red Led), Left and Right Indicators(Yellow Leds). in addition to the Light sensor for automatic mode.
The final board of choice is the ESP8266 because all the pins with the exception of GPIO16(D0) have external interrupt capability, opposed to only 2 pins on the Arduino UNO board.
