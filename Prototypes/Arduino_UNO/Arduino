The prototypes images are namely :  the Headlamp, Right and Left Indicators and Circuit with sensor for automatic mode connected to an Arduino board.
The indicators circuit is missing the push buttons which on the final product will be replaced by the capacitive sensors
Initial testing without the push buttons was done manually by activating the Right and Left Indicators through the code by a acivating a HIGH signal.
