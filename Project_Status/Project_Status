Simulated Left and Right LED on tinkercad.
The simulation was to test out the circuitry in addition to the Interrupt Routines (ISR). 
Lesson learnt from this is we have only 2 external intterupts on Arduino. 
The project needs 3 external interrupt pins to control the Headlmap as well. 
I choose to switch to ESP8266, which can accomodate these requirements.
The circuit has been on ESP8266 and testing will be moving forward using this board.
